# MonteCarloProblemMarbles
How we can use Java to demonstrate how asymtopes work.


Calculate the probability of selecting a certain marble from a bowl of marbles.
        
        Algorithm:
        Create unique variable for blue/white marbles
        Add variables to count attempts/success
        Loop simulation
        Create an array to simulate the bowl.
        Create an array to hold marbles selected.
You will notice that as we get closer to infinity the degree of accuracy increases also. 
This is a perfect example how asymtopes work.
